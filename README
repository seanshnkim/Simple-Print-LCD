## Overview
This project demonstrates how to print text to the embedded LCD of the STM32F429I-Discovery board. It contains minimum number of code. The main take-away here is to learn how `SysTick_Handler()` works.

It uses PlatformIO within Visual Studio Code.

## Requirements

- **Board**: STM32F429I-Discovery
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO extension
- **PlatformIO Core**: 6.1.18  
- **PlatformIO Home**: 3.4.4

## Usage

Build and flash the project using PlatformIO. Upon successful upload, boot the board: a message should be printed to the LCD screen.

## Discussion: What About `SysTick_Handler()`?

- What happens if you remove `stm32f4xx_it.h` and `stm32f4xx_it.c` from this project?
- What does `SysTick_Handler()` specifically have to do with printing text on the LCD?
- What roles do these files play, and how are they related to exception and interrupt handling?
